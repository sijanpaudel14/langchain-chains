text = """Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a transformative field of computer science that focuses on creating machines capable of performing tasks that traditionally require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, decision-making, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns and images, and even exhibiting creativity. AI is built on a foundation of mathematics, statistics, and logic, often enhanced through the use of machine learning algorithms that allow systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. The field of AI encompasses a wide range of sub-disciplines, such as natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, robotics, and neural networks. In recent years, advancements in computational power and the availability of large datasets have significantly accelerated the development of AI technologies, leading to practical applications in nearly every sector, including healthcare, finance, education, transportation, and entertainment. For example, AI is used to power voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, detect diseases from medical scans with higher accuracy, automate trading in stock markets, and personalize content on streaming platforms. Despite its potential, AI also raises critical ethical concerns such as bias in algorithms, data privacy, job displacement due to automation, and the need for transparency and accountability in decision-making systems. To address these challenges, researchers, policymakers, and technologists are increasingly working together to ensure the development of responsible and human-aligned AI. Ultimately, AI holds the promise of greatly augmenting human capabilities, solving complex global problems, and reshaping the way we live and work in the digital age."""
